        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en"></terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">Defines physical quantities in the International System of Quantities (ISQ). ISQ was made an official ISO standard in 2009 and is defined in the ISO/IEC 80000 standard.

ISQ underlines the SI system and defines physical quanties that are measured with SI units.

ISQ has 7 base quantities and many derived quantities defined in terms of the 7 base quantities.

The number of derived quantities not closed and may increase based on the need by domain ontologies.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">Defines properties as the result of an observation process. Observation is a semiotic process that stimulate an interpretant within the interpreter who communicates the perception result to other interpreters through a sign, which is the property.

Hence, properties creates a link between the holistic and the perceptual perspectives.

Subclasses of property are subclasses that spesialise the type of observation process.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">Defines the formal language of metrology, including theoretical and practical aspects of measurements.

This module is based on the International vocabulary of metrology (VIM) as well as the ISO/IEC 80000 standard.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">Defines the holistic perspective which include process and the role of its participants.

Processes are 4D object&apos;s that unfolds in time in a way that has a meaning to the ontologist with participants who&apos;s role is assigned by the ontologist.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">Defines the perceptual perspective, which which categorises real world objects according to how they are percieved by an user as a recognisable pattern in space or time. 

The perceptual module includes formal languages, pictures, geometry, mathematics and sounds. Phenomenic objects can be used in a semiotic process as signs.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">Defines the reductionistic perspective, which uses the fundamental non-transitive parthood relation, called direct parthood, to provide a powerful granularity description of multiscale real world objects.  EMMO can in principle represents the Universe with direct parthood relations as a direct rooted tree up to its elementary constituents.

In addition to direct parthood, the reductionistic module defines &apos;State&apos; as a tesselation of spatial direct parts with no change of granularity or cardinality and &apos;Existent&apos; as a tesselation of temporal direct parts.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">Defines the root of the physicalistic perspective that introduces the concept of real world objects that have a meaning for the ontologist under an applied physics perspective.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">Describes manufacturing processes with engeneered participants. The module also provides a root for engeneered materials.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">Elemental Multiperspective Material Ontology (EMMO)

EMMO is a multidisciplinary effort to develop a standard representational framework (the ontology) based on current materials modelling knowledge, including physical sciences, analytical philosophy and information and communication technologies.

It provides the connection between the physical world, materials characterisation world and materials modelling world.

EMMO is released under a Creative Commons license Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">Introduces the fundamental mereotopological concepts of EMMO and their relations with the real world objects that they represent. EMMO uses mereotopology as the ground for all the subsequent ontology modules.  

The concept of topological connection is used to define the first distinction between ontology entities namely the &apos;Item&apos; and &apos;Collection&apos; classes.  Items are causally self-connected objects, while collections are causally disconnected.  

Quantum mereology is represented by the &apos;Quantum&apos; class. This module introduces also the fundamental mereotopological relations used to distinguish between space and time dimensions.

Defines &apos;Physical&apos;, which is the superclass for all real world objects and its complement, &apos;Void&apos;. It also define the &apos;Elementary&apos; class, that restricts mereological atomism in space.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">Ontology to model processes</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">The chemistry module populates the physicalistic perspective with materials subclasses categorised according to modern applied chemistry.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">The domain module is a container that imports some common domain extensions of EMMO middle. The intension is to provide examples for developers of EMMO-based domain ontologies.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">The materials module populates the physicalistic perspective with materials subclasses categorised according to modern applied physical sciences.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">The math module defines the formal language of mathematics. Mathematical objects represents graphical objects based on graphical symbols arranged according the rules of math.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">The models module defines models as semiotic signs that stands for an object by resembling or imitating it, in shape or by sharing a similar logical structure.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">The module &apos;siunits&apos; defines the 7 base units and 22 derived units as well as the metric prefixes specified in the SI system.

All additional derived units, SI-based or not, goes into the &apos;units-extension&apos; module.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">The module &apos;units-extension&apos; defines all units in EMMO middle that are not included in the &apos;siumits&apos; module.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">The periodic table domain ontology provide a simple reference implementation of all atoms in the periodic table with a few selected conventional properties.  It is ment as both an example for other domain ontologies as well as a useful assert by itself. Periodic table is released under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license (CC BY 4.0).</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">The perspective module provides the practical implementation of the EMMO pluralistic approach for which the only objective categorization is provided by the Universe individual and all the Quantum individuals.

Between these two extremes, there are several subjective ways to categorize real world objects, each one provide under a &apos;Perspective&apos; subclass.</terms:abstract>
        <terms:abstract xml:lang="en">The semiotics module is based on the semiotic theory by Charles S. Peirce. It introduces the triadic semiotic process, called semiosis, with its participants an &apos;object&apos; that is represented by a &apos;sign&apos; producing another sign, the &apos;interpretant&apos; and finally the &apos;interpreter&apos; who connects the &apos;object&apos;, &apos;sign&apos; and &apos;interpretant&apos;.

The role of abstract objects are in EMMO fulfilled by semiotic objects, i.e. real world objects (e.g. symbol or sign) that stand for other real world objects that are to be interpreted by an agent. These symbols appear in actions (semiotic processes) meant to communicate meaning by establishing relationships between symbols (signs).</terms:abstract>
