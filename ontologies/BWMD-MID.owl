        <obo:IAO_0000232 xml:lang="en">v1.0.10 (2022-09-06): changed language from german to english on &quot;hasShape&quot;, &quot;influencedBy&quot; and others. Added &quot;isSubpropertyOf&quot; to some ObjectProperties by Martin Huschka.

v1.0.9 (2021-11-12): hasImpactOn, influencedBy and hasQuality added as Object Property by Martin Huschka.


v1.0.8 (2021-04-14): &quot;hasShape&quot; added as dataProperty and MetaDataset added as subclass of DataSet in order to describe the Hdf%Container structure. &quot;FileName&quot; was added as a Subclass of Name. Changes performed by Elena G Trelles (Fraunhofer IWM in the context of the HUB Episode VI-sprint V).

v1.0.7 (2021-03-11): Subclasses of &quot;Identifier&quot; contained in the &quot;domain&quot; module were transfer to the mid-level module with updated IRIs. The new classes ExternalObjectID, URLToFile, and HDF5File were added to the mid-level module. Changes performed by Elena G Trelles (Fraunhofer IWM).

v1.0.6 (2020-12-07): Data properties (hasBooleanLiteral, hasURILiteral) added by Martin Huschka (Fraunhofer EMI).

v1.0.5 (2020-12-04): Annotations were added to every entity by Christoph Schweizer.

v1.0.4 (2020-11-04): Updated by Elena G Trelles (Fraunhofer IWM). MaterialName added as subclass of Name, hasDateLiteral (range:xds:dateTime) added as DataProperty, ranges specified as well for hasDoubleLiteral (xds:double) and hasIntegerLiteral (xds:integer)

v1.0.3 (2020-11-04): Updated format properties by Elena G Trelles (Fraunhofer IWM). Addition of data/object properties as subproperty of topProperty.

v1.0.2 (2020-11-04): Import GraphDesigner (GD) Ontology and added GD-annotations to some classes, object properties and data properties.

v1.0.1 (2020-10-20): Basic activities performed: All datatypes of labels were changed from xsd:string to xml:lang=&apos;en&apos;. Language tag of the annotation properties &quot;author&quot; and &quot;curator&quot; were adapted to &apos;en&apos;. Curator &apos;Simon Stier&apos; added.

v1.0.0 (2020-10-12): The BWMD-Ontology was curated within the DMD4F-project. It was divided into two modules: &apos;mid&apos; and &apos;domain&apos;. The ontology IRI was changed and the IRI-naming convention was altered in order to incorporate iterative IDs, the former entity-IRI now is the &apos;label&apos;. Curation performed by Martin Huschka, Philipp von Hartrott und Simon Stier.</obo:IAO_0000232>
