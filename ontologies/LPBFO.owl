        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">The LPBF Ontology can be used to describe the additive manufacturing of a component via Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) / Selective Laser Melting (SLM). The ontology builds on BFO2.0 and BWMD_mid and has been developed to be used in conjunction with the digital workflows provided by Fraunhofer IWM. If possible, the terminology within this ontology was used as provided by ISO/ASTM 52900:2015. Historically, it was created as LPBFO ontology; an ontology that described the SLM process at Fraunhofer EMI. However, it is now being used for other applications as well, some leftovers named EMISLM might still be apparent until being updated.</rdfs:comment>
