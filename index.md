Created with [ROBOT version 1.9.0](http://robot.obolibrary.org/) and [OBO Metadata Schema](https://github.com/OBOFoundry/OBO-Dashboard/commit/b88e6f1fe9e7c6683b97bbe32c384719ad834e12).

A very basic analysis of the results can be found [here](https://ebrahimnorouzi.github.io/mseo.github.io/dashboard/analysis.html).
